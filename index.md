### Welcome to RSAT Training material

### Aim of RSAT
The release of complete genomic sequences not only offered a huge
amount of new data for the molecular biologist, but also impulsed the
development of new computational techniques required for the analysis
of these data.
Non-coding sequences present a striking interest since they govern the regulation of gene
expression.

The [Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (RSAT)](http://rsat.eu) offers a series of tools dedicated to the detection of
regulatory signals in non-coding sequences. Each tool is presented as a form to fill. For each form, a manual page
provides detailed information about the parameters. 


### Where to start ?
To get familiar
with the tools, we recommend you to follow the <B><A
